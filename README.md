This project was the first data analysis project I worked on while at Bangkit Academy. In this data analysis project, I used one of the datasets that have been provided, namely the E-Commerce Public Dataset. I had to carry out the entire data analysis process started from defining questions to making conclusions from the analysis results. Apart from that, project data analysis must meet the following requirements: there are a minimum of 2 business questions (analysis questions) that will be answered through the data analysis process.

After carried out the analysis process, I then had to create a dashboard as a medium for conveying the results of data analysis interactively. In this project, I created a dashboard using streamlit
